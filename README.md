# Dotfiles
My configurations.

## Initial Setup and Installation

If on OSX, you will need to install the XCode CLI tools before continuing. To do so, open a terminal and type

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then, clone the dotfiles repository to your computer. This can be placed anywhere, and symbolic links will be created to reference it from your home directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WDZThorn/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```
